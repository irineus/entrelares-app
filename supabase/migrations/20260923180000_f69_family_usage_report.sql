-- =============================================================================
-- F-69 — admin_family_usage_report(p_family_id): how ONE family uses the
-- product, for the operator console. Metrics and dates, never content.
--
-- WHY. The family 19 analysis (21/09/2026) took a session of hand-written
-- read-only SQL in production across ten tables plus GoTrue internals. The
-- owner gets the same facts from the console in one tap, and every tap is
-- audited, instead of from ad-hoc SQL nobody records.
--
-- THE RULE THE PAYLOAD KEEPS (owner, 21/09/2026). Every value is a COUNT, a
-- DATE, an ID or a closed ENUM. No free text leaves the family: not the
-- family name, member names or e-mails (the console already holds those from
-- `admin_list_families` and joins by `profile_id`), not the day note, the
-- swap message/approval note/rejection reason, the aviso note, the F-67
-- relato, a notification's title/message/params, a push token or its
-- `device_label`, and not a CUSTOM role's name or emoji (F-41: typed by the
-- family) — a custom role reads `'custom'`. The DB gate walks the returned
-- JSON and fails on any key outside a closed list, and seeds a family with a
-- marker in every one of those columns to prove none of them comes back.
--
-- SECURITY. F-58's shape: SECURITY DEFINER, the operator gate on `auth.uid()`
-- (`is_platform_operator()`, never `current_user` — T-35), and EVERY call
-- written to `operator_audit_logs`, an unknown family included (the
-- `admin_lookup_family` rule: an access attempt that found nothing is still
-- an access attempt). Read-only, so no S-10 elevation — the same as the
-- lookup and the listing; §10 of the policy says so since this item.
--
-- "LAST ACTIVE" (owner, 23/09/2026). `member_activity_days` (T-78) is the
-- source. It only exists from 23/09/2026, so for a member with no row yet
-- the report falls back to GoTrue's latest session touch — the DATE only,
-- never the user agent or IP that table also holds — and says so in
-- `last_active_source = 'auth_sessions'`, which the console prints as
-- approximate. A session row disappears on sign-out and expiry, so the
-- fallback can only UNDER-state recency. It goes in a later PR, once every
-- live member has activity rows.
--
-- DAYS are `America/Sao_Paulo`, like every other day rule of the product.
-- A TRANSITION is T-27's own test (the trigger's and U-55's): no D-1 row, or
-- a different effective carer. Weeks start on Monday, and a calendar EDIT
-- is one SAVE, not one row: rows stamped with a `batch_id` fold into one, as
-- the Histórico folds them (F-51), and the rest fold by author and
-- `created_at` — the transaction timestamp, shared by every row one save
-- writes (the wizard's first generation carries no batch id, and the T-27
-- trigger logs the next day in the same transaction). Measured on family 19:
-- 387 log rows by the admin were 82 saves.
